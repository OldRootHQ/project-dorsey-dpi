# OldRoot Website Patch Log

This file is the release ledger for meaningful public website changes. Each deployed site update should add an entry here and, when visitor-facing, a short matching note in `news.html`.

## 2026-09-26 — OR-WEB-0001 — Locations globe stability rebuild

### Changed
- Rebuilt the Locations globe around the original stable global-navigation model.
- Removed the unstable deep-zoom / live city-boundary interaction stack from the globe.
- Capped globe zoom to a controlled global range.
- Preserved Earth View, Space View, drag rotation, location selection, dossier links, and URL hash navigation.
- Removed the extra Washington, D.C. reference node from the public location-node set.
- Marked St. Dorsey globe placement as schematic instead of presenting invented coordinates as canon.
- Added keyboard-accessible location nodes and explicit selection state on location-index buttons.
- Improved mobile interaction so the globe no longer claims all touch scrolling behavior.
- Added reduced-motion handling for pulsing location markers.
- Reduced world-map detail from `countries-50m` to `countries-110m` for a lighter global view.

### Styling
- Added `locations.css` as an isolated Locations feature stylesheet.
- Retained OldRoot Root Green, Deep Root Green, Cream, Parchment, Café/Bark neutrals, Silver, and Old Gold visual language.
- Kept the existing technical console / editorial terminal presentation.

### Validation
- JavaScript syntax check required before merge.
- Internal location/dossier links required before merge.
- Branch diff review required before merge.
- Live deployment verification required after merge.

## 2026-09-26 — OR-WEB-0002 — Automated site smoke-test gate

### Changed
- Added a GitHub Actions smoke-test workflow for website changes.
- Added Chromium tests for the Locations globe covering all five public location nodes, keyboard selection, controlled zoom limits, Earth/Space modes, St. Dorsey schematic status, mobile touch behavior, and world-atlas failure fallback.
- Added JavaScript syntax checks for the site's shared scripts before browser tests run.

### Validation
- The workflow must pass on the repair code before this test gate is merged to main.
